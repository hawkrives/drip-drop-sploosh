A C++ attempt at the "Pouring water" problem with modifications using breadth-first search.

Built by [hawkrives](https://www.github.com/hawkrives) and [drewvolz](https://www.github.com/drewvolz)


## Problem

1. Implement breadth-first search: write a program that works on a graph that is given in a text file in DIMACS format.

2. Solve the pouring water problem (3.8), and this time find the minimum number of moves necessary to reach the goal (using C++).

3. Solve a variation on the pouring water problem: what if we have five buckets with capacity 23, 29, 31, 37, and 41, respectively, and we start with the first and last buckets filled (the rest are empty), can we get the three largest buckets to contain 4 each? If no, how many nodes must we search to learn this fact, and if yes, how many moves does it take?


## How to compile and run

1. `make bfs`
