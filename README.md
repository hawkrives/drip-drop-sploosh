## Problem

1. Suppose you have a directed graph with four vertices called A, B, C, and D, and the edges are as follows: the out-edges of A go to B, C, and D, the out-edges of B go to C and D, and there is just one out-edge of C, which goes to D. Draw this graph on a piece of paper, and verify that it is a directed acyclic graph. Now, how many distinct paths can be used to travel from A to D? Hint: the answer is between 3 and 7.


## How to compile and run

1. `make bfs`
